		Taperecorder @VERSION Installation instructions

This program is designed for UNIXes, but it can be compiled in various
environments provided that there is a standard compiler and required libraries.

Compilation under Unix
----------------------

In order to compile this program, you must have:

  - A reasonably standard C compiler (and standard C library with
    corresponding header files of course).
  - The 'libconfig' library

The instructions are general for most Unix software in source form:

* Uncompress the sources distribution:

  $ tar jxvf taperecorder-@VERSION.tar.bz2
  or
  $ tar zxvf taperecorder-@VERSION.tar.gz

* Change to the sources directory:

  $ cd taperecorder-@VERSION

* Configure the package:

  $ ./configure

  This default configuration will probably be just fine. However, you
  may add some configuration options to the end of that line.  Run
  configure with `--help' to get full list of them, like this:

  $ ./configure --help

  By default the program executable will be installed in
  /usr/local/bin and the lessons and internationalization support
  files in /usr/local/share/taperecorder (you can change this with the
  `--prefix' option).  By default Native Language Support will be
  installed (but you can disable this with the `--disable-nls'
  option).

* Build the package:

  $ make

* Get required permissions and install the package:

  $ sudo make install

  The sudo program will ask you for the root password to install
  taperecorder system-wide.  If you do not have the root password, you will
  not be able to install it system-wide.  Instead, you should run
  configure with something like '--prefix=~/opt' to install it in your
  home directory.

* To test your installation type

  $ taperecorder

  If you already had a version of taperecorder installed on the system
  before you installed this one,you may need to explicitly state which
  one you want to run. So you may need to type:

  $ /usr/local/bin/taperecorder
